  def caveats; <<~EOS
    All pilot-link commands (such as pilot-xfer) require a port argument (-p).
    On OS X, the correct port is "usb:" (note the trailing colon). As an
    example, you would use the following command to list the databases on the
    Palm OS device:

        pilot-xfer -p usb: -l

    To avoid having to type "-p usb:" each time, put the following in your
    ~/.bashrc to set the PILOTPORT environment variable:

        PILOTPORT="usb:"

    EOS
  end

  test do
    system "pilot-xfer", "--version"
  end
end
